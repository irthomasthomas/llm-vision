# GPT4-Vision-Toolkit: A Powerful Image Analysis Tool

GPT4-Vision-Toolkit is a versatile and user-friendly command-line tool that harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 vision model to analyze and describe images. With its simple interface and diverse output options, this tool makes it easy for users to extract valuable insights from visual data.

## Key Features

1. **Image Description**: GPT4-Vision-Toolkit can generate detailed, natural language descriptions of input images. Simply provide an image path or pipe in an image, and the tool will output a comprehensive description of the visual content.

2. **Flexible Output Formats**: The tool supports multiple output formats, including plain text, JSON, and Markdown. This allows users to integrate the generated descriptions into their workflows seamlessly, whether they need structured data for further processing or human-readable content for documentation.

3. **Streaming Mode**: GPT4-Vision-Toolkit offers a streaming mode that enables real-time processing of image data. By piping in an image and using the `--stream` flag, users can receive the image description as it is generated, making it ideal for interactive applications or large-scale image analysis.

4. **Customizable Prompts**: Users can provide custom prompts to guide the image description process. This feature allows for more targeted analysis and enables users to extract specific information from images based on their unique requirements.

## Installation

To install GPT4-Vision-Toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPT4-Vision-Toolkit.git
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

To use GPT4-Vision-Toolkit, run the following command:

```
python GPT4-vision-toolkit.py [OPTIONS] [IMAGE_PATH] [PROMPT]
```

Options:
- `--output [text|json|md]`: Specify the output format (default: text).
- `--stream`: Enable streaming mode for real-time processing.

Examples:
- Describe an image:
  ```
  python GPT4-vision-toolkit.py image.png "Describe the contents of this image."
  ```

- Pipe in an image and use streaming mode:
  ```
  cat image.png | python GPT4-vision-toolkit.py --stream
  ```

## Future Development

While GPT4-Vision-Toolkit already offers a range of powerful features, there are several exciting opportunities for future development:

1. **Screen Capture**: Implement a `--screen` option to allow users to capture and analyze screenshots directly from their devices.

2. **Interval-based Analysis**: Add `--interval` and `--similarity-threshold` options to enable periodic image analysis and change detection.

3. **Multi-monitor Support**: Introduce a `--monitor` option to support image analysis across multiple monitors or display devices.

By continually expanding its capabilities, GPT4-Vision-Toolkit aims to become an indispensable tool for anyone working with visual data, empowering users to extract meaningful insights and streamline their image analysis workflows.
